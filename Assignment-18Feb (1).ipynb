    "## 1).API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. It specifies how different software components should interact with each other. An example of API usage in real life is when you use a social media application to login into another application. In this case, the second application uses the social media application's API to verify your identity and log you in."
